# Overview

Allows to import immune assay data (nucleotide or aminoacid) with any metadata attached to the sequences. It aligns clonotypes with the assay data database and assigns this metadata information to clonotypes (using mmseqs2 easy-search).

MMseqs2 is developed by the SÃ¶ding lab and Steinegger group. For more information, please see: [https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2) and cite the following publication if used in your research:
