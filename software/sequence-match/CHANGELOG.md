### Patch Changes

- ac20364: Bump everything to fix docker image

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 2036371: Migrate onto the block-tools structurer (tool-managed layout: oxlint/oxfmt,
  ts-builder, regenerated configs) and bump the SDK to latest (model/ui-vue
  1.79.14, workflow-tengo 6.6.3, tengo-builder 4.0.8). No block behavior change —
  the model was already on BlockModelV3.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- cd67e1a: Add "Sequence Match" matching mode — a recall-guaranteed, alignment-free match that reports every target containing an assay sequence as an exact substring (the deterministic equivalent of an MMseqs2 id=1/cov=1 search). Implemented in a new `sequence-match` Python software package using polars' Aho-Corasick scan. Exposed via a top-level "Matching mode" control (Alignment vs Sequence Match); Sequence Match hides the MMseqs2-only controls and is gated to same-alphabet assay/target pairs.
